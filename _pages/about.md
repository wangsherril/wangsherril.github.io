Hi! I’m Xuemeng Wang, a Ph.D. student in Applied and Computational Mathematics at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/math.html). My research lies in applied mathematics, with a focus on scientific computing, scientific machine learning, and active learning. I'm currently working under the supervision of Dr. [Ben Adcock](https://benadcock.org/) at SFU.

I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics from [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/), and later completed an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics at [the University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).

Outside of research, I enjoy musical theatre and gaming.  
<!-- Lately, I’ve been exploring music production and trying out rock climbing. -->

Feel free to drop me an [email ✉️](mailto:xwa265@sfu.ca) if you'd like to connect!
