Hi! I’m Xuemeng Wang, a Ph.D. student in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Simon Fraser University.  
My research focuses on applied mathematics, particularly in scientific computing, scientific machine learning, and active learning.

I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics from Hong Kong Baptist University and completed an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics at the University of British Columbia.

Outside of research, I enjoy musical theater and gaming. Lately, I’ve been exploring music production and trying out rock climbing — both challenging in their own fun ways!
