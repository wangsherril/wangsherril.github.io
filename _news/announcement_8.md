ðŸ“˜ My M.Sc. degree has been officially conferred, and my thesis, *[Damping of Surface Waves by a Floating Dissipative Plate](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0441452)*, is now archived in UBC cIRcle. Grateful to my supervisor, Dr. Neil Balmforth, for the invaluable support along the way.
